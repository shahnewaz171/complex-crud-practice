## Backend Setup
Firstly, we need to download api file from the below link here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nMKwtGQ9s0sxq7cJ8VzEOOWBP7fRix8P/view?usp=sharing

- Unzip the downloaded file in your local PC
- Go to htdocs folder of the xampp and put that file in this htdocs folder
- Then, click on Apache in the xampp
- After that, test this url - http://localhost/api/index.php

## Frontend Setup
Clone this repository with the below command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahnewaz171/complex-crud-practice.git
```

Once this is done, we need to install the dependencies via the following command. If your local machine didn't have installed yarn then we will go to the npm.

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
# or
npm start
```
